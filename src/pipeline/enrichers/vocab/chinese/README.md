### What is CC-CEDICT?

CC-CEDICT is a continuation of the CEDICT project started by Paul Denisowski in 1997 with the aim to provide a complete downloadable Chinese to English dictionary with pronunciation in pinyin for the Chinese characters. This website allows you to easily add new entries or correct existing entries in CC-CEDICT. Submitted entries will be checked and processed frequently and released for download in CEDICT format on this page.
